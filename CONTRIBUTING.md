Welcome to the project! This is to answer any contributing related questions you might have, so contributors read on!

## General Rules
Other than the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/comprowinter/LastLecture/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), there are two other rules:

1. Student and Alumni of KGMPA are the only ones who commit code
2. The Lectures on the site must be from alumni of KGMPA

Last Lectures aren't unique to our school, and the code that gets written will almost certainly be the work of amateurs, but we want the site to be as much a part of our school as the lectures are. Even if you can't directly contribute code or writing, please feel free to see the [issues tab](https://github.com/comprowinter/LastLecture/issues) to submit feature requests or bug reports.

## I don't see my Lecture?
Don't see your lecture on the site? We've done our best to show as many lectures as we can, but mistakes are made everyday. To get your lecture on the site there are two things that can be done:

1. Submit an [issue](https://github.com/comprowinter/LastLecture/issues).
<tab>Be sure to include your name, graduating year, and the full text of your lecture. As soon as we verify you are an alumni, we can put your lecture up.
2. Email current coordinators
<tab>**This option might take longer, please try #1 first.** The current site maintenance are more than happy to be reached out to individually, but the response time will be longer. They will still need your name, graduating year, and lecture, but can put it on the site just the same.

## Bug Reports
There is a template to use for Bug Reports, but there is some information that should definitely be included.

* What were you doing to find the bug?
* What did you expect to happen?
* Steps to reproduce the bug.

After you submit a report, please watch it. If developers have any problems they might need to ask questions. If you are a KGMPA student/alumni and want to submit a pull request for a bug you filed that is fine, but wait a bit to get the green light from a developer before starting so everyone is in the loop.

## Feature Requests
Anyone is more than welcome to drop feature requests in the [issues tab](https://github.com/comprowinter/LastLecture/issues). After submitting a request, keep an eye on it. A developer might want you to answer questions or maybe even test out your feature to make sure everything works properly. There is a template for Feature Requests if you get lost, so don't be afraid to use it.

Alumni/current students are also more than welcome to submit a pull request for a feature, but be sure to get the green light from a developer before starting.

## Road Map
Here is some general ideas of where the site might be going. The developers will sort of follow this list as they can, but you could also contribute to any you are comfortable with. This will be updated, so checking back might be good.

- [ ] Wiki Documentation / Social Profile

- [ ] Sort table

- [ ] Search bar

- [ ] Better UI/UX (prettify)

- [ ] Developer tools

- [ ] Better lecture pages

- [ ] More media options (text, video, audio)

- [ ] Social Media buttons

...

- [ ] Get on maeserprep.org?

## Joining the Project
Alumni move on, and new student developers replace them. You can choose to contribute on whatever basis you want, but feel free to reach out to the current maintainers and developers if you are interested in becoming an official member of the team, but **DO NOT MAKE AN ISSUE TO ASK**.
