            <h1>The Hands That Saved Me</h1>
            <h5>Jocelyn Garcia</h5>
            <p>A few unexpected things happened in the past four years here at Maeser.</p>
            <p>I passed AP stats.</p>
            <p>I met my soul sister at locker 364.</p>
            <p>I somehow stayed quiet in class for one day. Just one.</p>
            <p>I somehow got someone to stop hating me and now he’s my best friend.</p>
            <p>But the one I never imagined was that it would be characters in books who would  help me through life’s everyday moments. Every book I read within these walls has been a hand reaching down to save me from an abyss.</p>
            <p>I survived in the ocean with Pi, and learned what it’s like to really suffer. I learned endurance, and somehow I knew I wasn’t alone in the world even when stranded with a tiger on a carnivorous island.  Pi was my personal lifeguard, never making me feel insignificant.  Pi was my sign of hope, who fought beside me as I battled with doubt.  I’ve given up before and been scraped by the coral sharp bottom that tangled me in my desperation. I didn’t think that I was worth anything. Then Sterling Scholar’s competition came and I turned in my photos and I didn’t even want to hope. I was terrified. Pi helped me survive through the interviews and all of a sudden viola! I was sterling scholar for this school, and then for region.</p>
            <p>I cried on the shoulder of Viktor Frankl when the relationships in my life disintegrated and withered.  I lost one of my best friends this year and I was devastated.  When I read a Man’s Search for Meaning,Viktor Frankl was at my side, telling me if I could endure my suffering I could find meaning in life. Surprising that a book provided a shoulder to cry on better than a bowl of Ben and Jerry’s.</p>
            <p>I partied with Jay Gatsby. We were like the champagne and the stars.  Gatsby desired something so much that he forgot the world around him. So did I. I wanted to please everyone and ended up losing everyone and everything. I let go of my own identity and fell out of touch with myself. I was on the soccer team and I loved it, I loved playing and being part of a team. But then I got scared and didn’t truly feel accepted on the team for the person I was. So my default was quitting the team and letting go of something I loved. I fell for the glittery lie of social acceptance--caring too much  what others thought of me. Who hasn’t? Gatsby warned me not to get swallowed up in my obsessions.  I’m not proud that when I looked in the mirror he was reflected back. I reached out for the green light  and almost fell into the choppy waves.</p>
            <p>I have to tell you all a secret. I may look calm and composed up here but I’ve never been completely okay sharing my words with others. Ironic, considering I was a debater for a long time and even made it to nationals. What everyone thinks of me has affected the way I associate with others, the way I interact. I’ve let parts of myself go for fear of what you would all say. The looks you would all give me. The whispers you would mutter behind my back.</p>
            <p>You know, here’s the thing, we go to Maeser, here playing Magic cards is regarded as a normal pastime, this is the place where you can be whoever you want to be a, where you’ll find someone that understands that, and maybe it’s going to be a character in a book. I really wish I had realized that before I let my own fear of what others thought decide the kind of person I was going to be.</p>
            <p>The trembling hasn’t stopped, but  not only did my literary friends save me from my own abyss, they showed me how to suffer with my family, let my friends cry on my shoulder, and hold my soul sister’s hand through her struggles. Every thing in these walls has been a hand reaching down to save me from an abyss and one day I want to be a hand reaching down to save someone. The way those books saved me.</p>
