            <h1>Love Oozers</h1>
            <h5>Lela Wooley</h5>
            <p>Everyone wants to see you succeed, just so long as you stay beneath them.</p>
            <p>HA! That’s bull. Why can’t we all be like Framptinez? Or like Rachel Linford? Riley Corrigan? Ashlyn Coyle? All of those people have something in common. They’re all Love Oozers. And what’s a Love Oozer?</p>
            <p>Well. Someone who oozes love is simply… pure and caring. Non-judgemental. They see the best of what’s in you, and they see your potential, and strive to coax it out. Those people wish to see others succeed in doing what they love.</p>
            <p>I mean, despite them all, certain people want to be better than you, maybe “be the very best like no one ever was”, but in all honesty, that’s not altogether possible. Go ahead and grumble to yourselves, I know, I know. Blanket statements are bad, I know. I’m serious, though. Don’t let it get you down that there are seemingly better people than you in the world. Why should that stop you from doing what you do? The world needs your view, your opinions, your ideas and thoughts and yearnings and dreams and passions and imagination and… love oozing.</p>
            <p>The fact is, there ARE people doing what you do. And a lot of them are doing it amazingly, right? Well, so what? Think about that for just a second. So. What. If you’re doing a thing, it’s worth doing, and if it’s important to you, why stop? It doesn’t matter that other people seem to be better than you. You’re good enough. So keep trying. Keep going. Keep growing. Love Oozing. Sharing. Passion...ing…</p>
            <p>The point is, there are so many Love Oozers who truly do want to see you succeed. Don’t take them for granted and ignore that text they sent, that email they forwarded, those little things that seem insignificant. You’ll deeply appreciate it one day. Make that day today. Every day. Look for the small things, the little “hi”s in the hallway, the miniscule waves from that girl you used to talk to but don’t anymore.</p>
            <p>I encourage you. TALK to that girl. SAY HI BACK. They say it all the time, that “a smile can change someone’s day”, and often, that’s really true. But if you don’t try, you’ll never know. How are you supposed to ooze love if you never try?</p>
            <p>Be like Framptinez. Be like Rachel Linford, Riley Corrigan, Ashlyn Coyle. Be… a Love Oozer. Because only good can come from it. Only you are capable of oozing your own kind of love to others. Be the oozingest lover you can.</p>
            <p>To all of Maeser - may you continue to go forward with much love to ooze. I have the utmost confidence in you.</p>
