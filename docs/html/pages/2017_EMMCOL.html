            <h1>Convinced</h1>
            <h5>Emma Cole</h5>
            <p>I was convinced I was going to die for the majority of my Freshman year. Tense shoulders, headaches, panic Attacks, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder ruled my life. Few things helped. Talking to Maren was one.</p>
            <p>Because she’d been through more in her 17 years than most people go through in a lifetime, she understood me unlike anybody else I knew.</p>
            <p>One day I came home from school feeling worse than usual. I tried to start on homework, but broke down, familiar terror filling my body. I shook. I hyperventilated. I couldn’t breathe. My teeth buzzed. Thoughts raced through my brain, and though I knew logically that it wasn’t true, I thought I was going to fail in school and life. As I laid tearstained, drained, and broken in the aftermath, I texted Maren. She left the library to FaceTime me. I laid there and told her about my day. At this lowest moment, even she didn’t know how to make me feel better. In futility, she grabbed a stick from the ground and held it up for me to see. She said she didn’t have anything to give me, being a poor college student. But she offered the stick if it would help. I smiled, probably for the first time that day, or even that week. I held up a hair elastic and said I didn’t have anything to give back to her, being a 14 year old girl, but I had that hair band.</p>
            <p>All we had to give was a stick and a hair elastic, but it was enough.</p>
