            <p>You would think after four years of Highschool that I would be great at staying up late to write Last Lectures and finish Calculus integrals but I'm not. You would have to be really good at math in order to count the times I have heard a teacher say you just need to work hard.</p>
            <p>People always say hard work is the way to succeed at anything. Do you want to write a great paper? Work hard, ask people for their opinions but you need to make an effort. What never gets recognised however is that there are times that trying your best and working hard doesn’t pay off and it's really hard to hear somebody say you could have done better when you tried as hard as you could. How most people manage that is by becoming objective hard workers. Picking aspects of their life that they will work hard at. One of those aspects for me is playing soccer. I've played for almost all of my life but I only realised that I wanted to be good at it my Freshmen year. So naturally by senior year you would think that I was at least decent at the game to the point where I could start varsity, the end goal for any soccer player, but if you're thinking that then you obviously don’t know me very well because I have the coordination of a blind astronaut.</p>
            <p>Some quick things that I thought of when going into my last season of playing soccer. I was a senior and I wasn’t that bad at playing my position. Those were the only things going for me. And when it came to our first game I warmed up with the varsity. Thats a good sign right? I didn’t play JV which again I thought, that's a good sign. But i also didn’t play varsity. When something doesn’t go to plan you start to speculate on why it didn’t follow the plan. How I justified not playing was by saying that my grades weren’t high enough so I fixed them. At this point almost half the season had gone past, I still hadn’t started and I was playing less than half of the JV games. So I went and asked coach “Hey what's going on?”. After a quick talk I started a race in my head. A race to start one game before the season was over. After practices and after games I would go home and work on the things I was told I needed to work on. As games rolled past and I still didn’t start i'm not going to lie it was getting to me, it was a little frustrating. In the end I never started a single game. I mean I started senior night but that doesn’t count. That's like saying you've kissed a girl just because you've kissed your mom. You just sound like an idiot. Don’t get me wrong I'm grateful for this experience but there is one thing that is missing from my story, and that's the fun I had playing. The times we did “drills” but we were actually just messing around. The crazy bus rides where everybody was throwing food, mostly trevor but you didn’t hear that from me. I missed the journey of my last soccer season because I got caught up in me not being good enough. I know people are going to complain that “it's cliche” or “its boring” but it's the truth. High School is going to suck, don’t put yourself down and most important of all Don't Miss The Journey.</p>
