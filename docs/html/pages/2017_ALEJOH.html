            <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
            <h5>Alexa Johnson</h5>
            <p>When I was younger I believed happiness was characterized by success, and success was characterized by one thing: Kraft Mac and Cheese. At age 5, I believed making my own pot of macaroni was the final frontier. My eyes brimming with determination, I marched home from the bus ready to tackle, what I considered, the ultimate accomplishment. After thrusting open the front door I shed my kindergarten sized backpack and pink lightup sketchers, internalizing every moment of food network I’d ever seen.
            <p>That day, I completed my life altering task of making my own macaroni, but it was the moment that followed which created a lasting impact. Situated at the bar stool of my kitchen counter, Mr. Roger’s “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood” echoed through the kitchen; as my chubby porcelain legs kept the beat, I took my first bite. I smiled, as warm cheese spread to the corners my lips. But something wasn’t quite how I pictured it. I was supposed to be hit with a wealth of knowledge and lifetime of experience, but I didn’t feel any different. I didn’t suddenly feel successful or complete . I was just me with a pot of macaroni.</p>
            <p>At that moment, I realized success was not characterized by Kraft Mac and Cheese, but it must be characterized by something. I would have to continue my quest for happiness. Once I succeeded, then I could be happy. As I got older I experienced a fluctuation of my definition of success. Success is riding a bike without training wheels , I thought. Success is learning to straighten my naturally curly hair. Success is driving a car, or kissing a boy or going skinny dipping. But as I completed each of these items on my mundane checklist of accomplishments, I found that I was still just me with a metaphorical pot of macaroni. I didn’t feel happy.</p>
            <p>I spent a good portion of my Maeser experience chasing pots of macaroni. Tasks I thought would make me feel successful and therefore, happy. Hours were spent on creating painstakingly perfect projects, cultivating toxic relationships for the social yeld, and altering my personality to become more likable. Some days it satisfied me, but when I fell short of my accomplishments, I would end up sobbing alone in my bedroom. I viewed failure as a direct reflection of my abilities and potential. My lust for life burned dim. My admiration and excitement began  rotting into anxiety. Rather than being my liquid life, grades and social status made me feel small and worthless. My abilities were no longer adequate. I was a failure.</p>
            <p>At the close of my junior year, I knew  I had to I uproot this harmful mindset. I needed to find happiness. Before I knew it, I found myself in a small island village buried in the blanket of the South Pacific. My purpose, service.</p>
            <p>Between wheelbarrows of gravel  and blistered hands, slabs of cement and the physical strain of service, I smiled. What I was building would change their life forever. Saki and his family lived in a concrete home with no doors or furniture. He made less in month than minimum wage employees make in a weekend , and when his family needed to use the bathroom, they’d have to walk a ½ mile through the village to use a relative's restroom. When Saki’s wife Emily heard we're we're building her a bathroom. She cried. When the bathroom was finished, I couldn't comprehend the volume of gratitude embedded in their faces. Through tear streaked eyes, Emily, Saki and their daughter Deborah wrapped me in a skin tight hug. This is what happiness tasted like.  The taste was nostalgic, like it had been on the tip of my tounge my whole life, I just never recognized it.  Happiness was cocktail of service infused with love and sprinkled with gratitude. Success part of the recipe,  but it was only the garnish. I’d been so focused on succeeding I discounted the practices that truly spark happiness.</p>
            <p>With the zest of life relaxed on my plate I returned to my arid Utah existence.  Now, I’ve shifted my mindset from succeeding to loving. My world is alive and I am entranced with living. I serve silently, love boldly and fail constantly. And that's okay; because failure does not mean YOU are a failure and happiness is not defined by metaphorical pots of mac and cheese.</p>
