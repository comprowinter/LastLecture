            <h1>He Gave Me His Hair</h1>
            <h5>Katie Clark</h5>
            <p>He gave me his hair. It’s freshman year, chivalry week, and my knight in shining armor gave me his hair. Little did I know that, two years later, I would repay the favor with a handful of my own hair, as a joke, which he would craft into a voodoo doll and return to me. Little did I know that, senior year, he would ask me to Homecoming with a stuffed bunny, a homemade poem, and another lock of his silky dark hair. I never would have remembered chivalry week if my knight had done something boring, like hold open a door or buy me a flower; now, I will never forget.</p>
            <p>Over spring break, my mother decided that my sister and I needed new swimsuits, so I was forced to chauffeur her from store to store until she could find a suit she liked. This should’ve been a short trip, except that my mother has a strict policy about only buying one-piece swimsuits. Naturally, we developed an unspoken rule that, for every store we went to, we had to try on a bikini. Just for fun, just for secret rebellion—we had to try, if only for the experience. This shopping ritual didn’t end when my sister accidentally locked herself out of her dressing room at American Eagle, where the only store clerks were attractive guys, or when she ditched me at the shop in the Riverwoods. It ended after we tried on matching stars and stripes bikinis at Target, before we realized the dressing rooms were co-ed. Swimsuit shopping has never made me laugh—or blush—so much.</p>
            <p>These unrelated experiences are alike in one way: they were created with other people. Memories are most beautiful when created collaboratively and spontaneously; by living in the moment with people you care about; and by loving as freely as you live.</p>
            <p>Don’t get me wrong—meaningful moments can happen in an isolated isle of books in the library, or on a scenic trail after a hike up the canyon. Some of my most profound thoughts have been generated in the solace of my shower. Falling in love with yourself, flaws and all, can be an extraordinary process, but nothing can replicate the feeling of singing Taylor Swift in the car with your friends or building a mentos bomb after Prom because, “Hey, I’ve got half an hour before my curfew and there’s an empty church parking lot right over there.” After all, inside jokes aren’t perpetuated single-handedly.</p>
            <p>While other people are like color in the water-painting of life, you can’t make memories by being a stick in the mud. The mere presence of other people isn’t going to suddenly attract memorable moments to your life story like an electromagnet. You have to be spontaneous and make sacrifices; you have to learn how to say yes. No human has ever opted out of a potentially embarrassing experience and thought, “Man, I’m so glad I didn’t sing that solo in the choir—I might have sung off-key,” or “what a relief I chose not to go to Prom—without a date, I might have felt awkward.” Most people actually regret not taking advantage of these opportunities because they realize that, while mortal embarrassment was certainly an option, those few minutes could have become their favorite memories, if only they were willing to try. They wish they had said yes, because while embarrassment is temporary, regret is permanent. Nobody wants to live with a banner of “woulda, coulda, shoulda” hanging over their heads, with the haunting “what if” leaving its rancid stench in the corners of your journal. You don’t have to say yes to tattooing half your left thigh and your collarbone if you don’t want to, but maybe you could ask your crush out on a date or take your siblings Trick-or-Treating, just for the possibility of a favorite memory.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, when you crawl into bed, under the blanket your Grandma sewed out of a pile of old jeans, and you close your eyes, you’re going to see yourself cheering at that football game with your Dad, or your sister hiding in your closet to scare you. You’re going to remember that one kid who taught you how to play Phase 10 over the summer, and slow dancing with your best friends. You’re going to remember the moments made spontaneously with people you care about, where you lived fully and loved freely, because those memories are the beautiful ones.</p>
