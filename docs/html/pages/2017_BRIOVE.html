            <h1>What is a Legacy?</h1>
            <h5>Brittany Overson</h5>
            <p>For the last six years, I have been a student at Maeser and let me just say this: I regret not thinking about my own legacy until senior year. I want to leave behind something that will hopefully help underclassmen in the future. Questions I asked myself this year and that I hope you will ask yourself are: What do I want to leave behind?How do you want the students in this school to remember you? What does your legacy mean to you?</p>
            <p>But first, what is a legacy? A legacy is something you do that future students will remember you by. My personal legacy I want to be remember for is asking the school: What is your legacy?</p>
            <p>Weird I know but that is a deep question I thought of in Socratic 12 this year.</p>
            <p>I want you all to really think deep about what it is that you want your legacy to be and why do you want to leave it behind for other Maeser students?  I personally have had multiple people who have left a legacy at Maeser and who have impacted my own life.</p>
            <p>My older sister Sara would tell me: “You need to go to class!” If she caught me ditching, she would ask, “Why aren’t you in class? You have to go to class to learn.  I would listen to her not just because Sara is my older sister but I really did need to be in class. Even if she doesn’t remember telling me these things I remember her always telling me to go to class.</p>
            <p>Other friends who left legacies at Maser and influenced my life are Kalei Tuia, who came up to me one day during school while I was crying and asked me if I was ok; Audraya Low,one of my best friends since I was in seventh grade, and Jaden Paxton,who always told me to go to seminary class with him every time I would tried to ditch. Lastly there is Jessica Meeks who was always saying “hey, pretty girl” to me during school and would always ask me how I was doing.</p>
            <p>Now I know what you are all thinking: Brittany how did the people you listed above who asked you How are you doing? How did they help you think about your own legacy? Well I will tell you, The friends who asked me those things helped me simply because they were reaching out to another student. That is why they helped me figure out what I want my own legacy to be. I want to help other students at Maeser figure out what their own personal legacies will be.</p>
            <p>I remember six years ago I walked into a school not knowing that I would want to leave a legacy behind at the end of my senior year. I wish I could go back in time to seventh grade me and tell myself: Brittany think about something you want to leave behind at Maeser. The time you have here will go by fast and you might not see it. It’s the truth so really consider what it is you want to leave behind you.</p>
            <p>In the end I hope you all will really take the time to think deep and hard about what you want your own personal legacy will be to leave at Maeser for the future. Seriously please don’t waste your time not thinking about a legacy. Start thinking about what you want your legacy to be because let me just say: Time will go by fast and you might not notice it. Start planning out your legacy and what you want it to be. By the time you are getting ready to graduate and leave Maeser you will have left a legacy behind you. Think really deep about what is it you do at Maeser that you want to leave behind as a legacy.</p>
            <p>Always remember to ask yourself this: What is a legacy to you? But more importantly: What is your legacy?</p>
