            <h1>Weakness is Like a Thought</h1>
            <h5>Erica Hendrickson</h5>
            <p>Mr. Simmons sprained my ankle once; he probably doesn't remember. It was four years ago at the end-of- the-year Quidditch match. One of the best friends I’ve ever had introduced me to the team two weeks earlier.</p>
            <p>The very first position I had was the one I disliked the most, keeper. As a freshman, I didn’t know how to play. I basically knew I was supposed to guard the hoops and prevent someone from making a goal.</p>
            <p>I stood in front of the hoops, grass, but mostly dirt under my shoes. Coach Neilson, in her penguin suit, held a purple bludger on my left, and Mr. Harmor on my right, trying to remain undetected. At the center of my attention, was the big, bad, Mr. Simmons, running straight at me with a quaffle clenched in his iron fisted hand. I was standing right in front of the smallest hoop, which happened to be the one he prefered to jump through. At this point, I had two choices: move out of the way and let him jump through the hoop in a flash of glory, or stay where I was. I chose the latter.</p>
            <p>You know, when you are at an amusement park, you have been wanting to ride the biggest, most twirly ride of them all, but as the clicks fade and you see the the crest of the iron bars, and the sudden drop and dread you feel? I had made a rollercoaster mistake.</p>  
            <p>I learned two days before, that as the keeper, I could keep my arm out to help stop  the momentum of the player with the quaffle, so I stuck my arm out, and hoped for the best.</p>
            <p>I remember someone’s foot stepping on my foot, making me fall like a sack of potatoes; I eat way too many potatoes. My foot made a screeching pop under the pressure of Mr. Simmon’s cleet.</p>
            <p>Fast forward two years. I had been playing for the official team BYU students had created, The Provo Night Furies. My knowledge and love for the game grew. Because of this, I was designated as the team captain for the teachers v.s. students Quidditch match. Older and tougher,  I was ready for Mr Simmons. As a team, we were stacked with seniors who’d played all four years. We had an amazing team and a lot of talented people. We were ready.</p>
            <p>This time...we beat the teachers.</p>
            <p>Finally in Maeser history, we beat the teachers, but, teachers want and work to see us win. Maybe not in competitive atmospheres with them, but they want us to win the challenges of life. There are four types of people to help with these challenges, chasers, keepers, seekers and beaters.</p>
            <p>First, there are the chasers, your classmates,  the people who inspire you to do greater. Through conversation or competition, they show you something as amazing as creation, the wonders of the world, making us want to become greater. By being examples and guiding lights, they lead you to bettering yourself. Through communication and support, they help with things beyond the classroom.</p>
            <p>Second are the keepers, they keep dreams a reality. The teachers who not only inspire, but stay by your side to help you become something more. They stay by the hoops, arms out stretched to stop the opposers from tearing down your goal. They see the entire field, knowing the best and easiest way to score, and will guide you to success.</p>
            <p>The third position, the seekers strive to find the nuggets of wisdom and share it with the world. People who push forward with every ounce of dedication for what they want. Often getting within millimeters of their goal, but missing by a hair and losing the golden snitch they battled for.</p>
            <p>Fourth, the beaters. The challenges and bullies who beat you and your goals to the dust. Even though they are the ones who sees your perfectly formed dreamcloud, they pop it, and let it fall into the chasm of doubt. They are the best people who can show you your weaknesses. Weakness is like a thought, no one else can tell you what it is, no one can see it. Through the beaters, You will overcome and stand stronger against the lifelessness of your dreams. By learning to overcome the tackle, strive for what you want and prove your strength.</p>
            <p>We all have the four players on the field trying to help us win this game, who will you be?</p>
