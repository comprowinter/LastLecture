            <h1>Offense: The Wall Between Us</h1>
            <h5>Dillon Frost</h5>
            <p>432000 minutes. My time at Maeser: 432000 precious minutes spent listening, reading, taking notes, and cramming for tests. In these minutes lies all of my education, where I have been given enough information pertaining to everything from Utah history to AP calculus to fill a small library. Reflecting on all of this time and the vast knowledge I have gained, one single fact stands out. I have forgotten almost all of it. No type of learning has been impervious to the onslaught of my faulty human brain. Dates, equations, plot lines, CPR training, definitions, and brilliant revelations are all now grains of sand on the vast deserts of what I have lost.</p>
            <p>But in one important way, it is good that I have forgotten all this. My brain has acted as a subconscious filter to decide what recieves to have the greatest honor of all, being remembered. The fact that people remember what they do is a powerful testament to what those things are worth. In the spirit of this, I’m going to share with you something that I remember</p>
            <p>clearly and is very important to me.</p>
            <p>5 years ago, I was sitting in 8th grade leadership, enjoying the ball of spontaneous and hilarious energy that many of us lovingly remember as Dr. Meeks. In the middle of a lesson, Dr. Meeks said something that has stayed with me throughout my time at Maeser. He said,</p>
            <p>“You know, you shouldn’t spend your entire life worrying so much about not offending people, you should spend it trying not to be so offendable.”</p>
            <p>That spur of the moment sentence has been something that I have looked back to frequently as I have navigated the complications that have come along while on my way to this moment. It has become a philosophy that I strive to live my life by and is what I would like to pass on to my fellow Maeser students.</p>
            <p>Offense has always been such an ugly word. It is a word that implies a malicious attack that has found its mark right in the soul of its target. Yet despite how ugly it is, I find that it is being used more frequently than so many other, much more important words. Words like understand, respect, and forgive. My philosophy is that offense is a word that puts up a barrier between us and other people, and as such, it is one that we need to use much more carefully.</p>
            <p>In the novel Fahrenheit 451, a future scenario is presented in which people live as shells of themselves. The walls of homes are replaced with televisions, headphones are worn constantly, and books are illegal and burned by the government. No one talks, no one thinks, and everyone believes they are happy while they find only emptiness. This seems like a ridiculous and unlikely extreme, but in the novel is layed out a familiar path that explains how this happened. As media become available to more and more people, the audience of every work became much larger. With that, more and more people would claim to be offended at whatever was written. In the novel, the authors’ solution to this is to fill the books with things that everyone wanted to hear as to avoid scrutiny. Books and all other media became empty, saying nothing and shaming thought, and so the people also became empty and thoughtless.</p>
            <p>A culture was crumbled because of walls put up by a word. My challenge to you is to not be stopped by this wall. If we continue to live afraid of it then we will lose our ability to confront what is important. When you have an ideal, an opinion, a belief, share it! Share why it is important and share what it means. If your goal is for the betterment of humanity and you are respectful of others, than anyone who is offended has no one to blame but themselves. And when other people share what matters to them, we need to realize that their goal is almost never to attack us or put us down, but it is them trying to make the world a better place themselves. Let us strive to replace our offense with thoughtful understanding, with human respect, and with forgiveness for the many things that people say and don’t really mean. With our propensity to forget, let's forget what has offended us and remember what makes every person so valuable.</p>
