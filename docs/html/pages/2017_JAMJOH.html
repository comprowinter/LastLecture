            <p>Hi guys. Last year, there was a super cool lecture held at UVU. An actor from a popular television show (which I will keep nameless) had flown in to speak to their drama department. My awesome older sister checked me out of school to take me to see it. He talked about his show and working in the acting business. At the end he opened it up for questions, and out of the gigantic crowd, he called on me. I asked if he had any good advice for actors, and he gave me the greatest piece of knowledge that I’ve ever received. He said only three words, “Fail, fail, fail.” At first I was confused, and I thought to myself, “Wait, don’t we want to avoid failure? Aren’t we supposed to succeed in life?” He went on to explain that the only way that we can improve is by failing, and learning from those experiences. He said that he went to dozens of auditions, and instead of quitting, he chose to learn something new with each failure.  Eventually, after working very hard to utilize all that he learned, he was able to get the leading role in which he currently resides. So, in order to succeed, we must learn from our failures and put in the necessary work to be better.</p>
            <p>Since I was a kid, I’ve loved theatre and performance, but there’s always been something holding me back. Something that you guys may not know about me, is that I’m on the autism spectrum. This has made acting and performance very difficult for me. By the end of freshman year, I had done many productions, and gone to a number of drama competitions, but I had almost never been cast as a lead, and I had done rather poorly at the competitions. I kept failing over and over again. My peers told me that I was just too awkward, and that I could never amount to anything as an actor. I was about ready to quit. It was then that I attended the aforementioned lecture. He helped me realize I could be anything I wanted to be, as long as I learn from my mistakes and put in the work to improve. So I chose to take these critiques and turn them on their heads. I started by improving my work ethic, because until this point I hadn’t really been working to fix anything, and I was letting these criticisms hurt me. Once I did this, I began to work on the things that I wasn’t the best at, like diction, inflection, movement, etcetera. After a long, difficult period of work, I am still pretty dang awkward both on and offstage, but I can say now that I am much better than I was. If I hadn’t have ever failed, I could never have improved, and I wouldn’t have had all of the recent success that I’ve had recently. There’s no way I could now have gotten 2nd place at State, accepted into the BFA of Acting Program at Utah State, or been the lead in our recent Much Ado About Nothing. Sorry, I don’t mean to toot my own horn, but I just wanted to show you guys what’s possible.</p>
            <p>Many people nowadays don’t want to follow their dreams because they are afraid of failure. If anything, they should embrace it. The only thing anybody should be afraid of is giving up. My greatest fear is that one day I’ll fail and then I won’t pick myself back up, and I’ll just completely abandon my dreams. I never want to go the other direction because it’s “too hard.” Kelly Coombs, one of my drama teachers always said, “Excuses don’t change results.” If you have a trial and you give up, you can’t blame the trial for you deciding to give up. The only person that can pick you up, and help you become better is yourself. So don’t ever be afraid of failure, because it is the only thing that will let you become what you strive to be. So I hope that all of you, while at Maeser and in the future, will get as many opportunities as possible to fail, fail, and fail again and then succeed because of the very failure you embraced.</p>
