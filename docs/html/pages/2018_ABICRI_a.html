            <h1>Become Uncomfortable, Become Vulnerable, Now Change</h1>
            <h5>Abigail Crist</h5>
            <p>You’ve probably by this point heard me talk about Acting Up, if not here’s a rundown. Acting Up is my second home, a place where I truly felt free to be me. I love Acting Up and I don’t think I realized that until a couple weeks ago. I have been in Acting Up for 3 years, for the first two years of it I gave my everything to this experience. In my third and final year, I shared it with my three best friends in the entire world: Katie, Rach, and TJ. Don’t get me wrong I’ve loved every minute of it, but I was nervous to completely show my musical theater side to my friends. The choice I had to make was difficult and thinking about it now I still don’t know how I did it. I made the choice to become vulnerable with my best friends. I know that might be like a, “Um Abby they’re your best friends. You should already be vulnerable with them,” but I promise you it’s different.</p>
            <p>They know everything there is to know about me, but they didn’t quite know about my insecurities around them. I had to open my heart and let them teach me how to be vulnerable.</p>
            <p>So what is vulnerability? To me it’s putting my heart out on the line and hoping the recipient will take good care of that precious part of me. To my acting group it means simply accepting all they come in contact with no matter how “different” or “weird” they are. To you it could mean taking a leap of faith and asking Mr. Watabe a question you hope won’t end with, “ABBY, did you not listen to me!” Or “ABBY Why are you laughing? MATH IS SIMPLE.” it could be sharing a joke and laughing till all you can do is snort, or your definition of being vulnerable could be as small as giving someone a hug. Being sensitive is different for everyone, but I think it all leads to the same destination and that is discomfort. And ultimately discomfort leads to change, and hopefully that change is for the better.</p>
            <p>Just for a second I want you to imagine the idea of being vulnerable. Does it scare you? I’m gonna let you in on a little secret… IT TERRIFIES ME! I know weird right? I totally seem like I have my whole life together. I know, I know I’m perfect… SAID NO 17 YEAR OLD EVER! I constantly live with the fear that no one will accept me as I am. I never thought that being vulnerable is indeed the main component of people accepting me! If we cannot be ourselves there is no room for bettering ourselves. There’s no room to let others love you and there’s definitely no room to learn from those moments where the recipients of our hearts might have accidentally dropped it and left us to pick up the pieces.</p>
            <p>For the past couple of months I have been teaching 4th graders how to sing, dance, and play the piano. They are putting their little hearts into my hands, trusting that I will carefully place it next to mine and connect with them. 4th graders will NOT listen to you if they think you don’t care. 4th graders would rather play with their homemade slime then sit and be berated by a senior in high school who has the mindset of, “I just need to finish this Capstone.” which I won’t lie to you, I’ve sometimes have had those thoughts, but to be honest, these couple of months have made me realize the importance of being vulnerable and I finally realized the importance of being uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>I’m going to tell you a story about a sweet girl named Claire. Claire is tone deaf, she doesn’t have pitch, but it’s Claire’s dream to be a singer. Claire came up to me one day and quietly asked, “Miss Abby… could you give me singing lessons..??” I cannot tell you the amount of love I felt for Claire in that moment, but I can tell you it continually grew throughout the months of lessons I gave her. Claire was able to give me her heart, and there were times where she was too nervous to sing for me. But there were times where she was confident enough to let me hear those sharp or flat notes and welcomed the advice of a senior in high school whose mindset changed to, “I can’t believe my senior Capstone is so close to being over and I’ve learned more from Claire than she has from me.” I’m not saying this to toot my own horn, but I am saying this to show you that if a 4th grade, tone deaf girl can open her heart so can you seniors of a small high school.</p>
            <p>I’d like to leave you with the words of the wise Mama Crist “To be Vulnerable means to put yourself in a situation that you normally wouldn’t be in. Yeah you might fail or you might Rock it, but being vulnerable gives you the opportunity to do it.” My mother is right! It’s not just about putting your heart on the line and hoping, but its about taking the opportunity to become uncomfortable. I challenge you to give someone a hug, laugh till your sides ache, even ask Mr. Watabe a “dumb” question. BE VULNERABLE! TAKE THOSE LEAPS OF FAITH! I promise you that it will change your life for the better. My life has definitely been changed, and I am able to be vulnerable with my friends in my musical theater world. I am no longer scared of making mistakes and my insecurities have vanished since I gave them each a piece of my heart. And I can honestly tell you, they will never leave my heart broken on the ground expecting me alone to pick up the pieces. They are there right beside me filling the cracks with their own pieces of their hearts. That is what vulnerability is to me.</p>
