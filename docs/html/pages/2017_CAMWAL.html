            <p>Every last lecture, no matter how unique, always has a few of the same themes. love your time in high school, make friends, be yourself, don’t procrastinate. Don’t get me wrong, those are all important, but I’m not just standing in front of you to parrot the banal platitudes you hear every year in a new way. I’m going to give you advice that I feel is less commonly shared</p>
            <p>It’s okay to be sad, sometimes that just happens. Anxiety, depression, stress, fear, they’re all a part of your life, don’t pretend they’re not, that’s unhealthy. Don’t wallow in them either though. Take them when they come, but you shouldn’t be seeking any of them out. It’ll pass.</p>
            <p>Procrastination is amazing. I never work harder than when I’m typing up a report at one AM on the day it’s due. Sometimes you just can’t do it when it’s assigned, for whatever reason, and you just need to put it off. It’s how I always worked, and It looks like I’m graduating, so….</p>
            <p>Bond with your teachers. It’s not something I did nearly enough, and might be one of my biggest regrets in high school. You don’t think anything of it until the end, but if you’re anything like me, you’ll wish you did. A lot of the teachers here are amazing people, people you’d be lucky to call your friends, and I really think you’re missing an opportunity if you’re not getting to know them better. They’re lives are full of amazing stories, and I wish I had heard a few more.</p>
            <p>High school isn’t necessarily the best 4 years of your life. You don’t need to spend them all trying to make them great if that isn’t what makes you comfortable. The average human lifespan is 79 years, meaning your time in high school is only about 5% of your life. Don’t make your entire existence hinge on this microscopic 5%. It’s important, but you have a lot more life to live and I don’t think you need to make this blink of an eye define you.</p>
            <p>Take online classes if that’s an option. They’re pretty convenient, and you’ll be thanking yourself once you’re a senior, and don’t have a first second or third period. Trust me, you’ll need the sleep.</p>
            <p>Don’t be yourself, because you don’t even know who you are yet. Be the person that you want to be, because you should be striving to be the best person you can be and you can’t be that if you’re staying stagnant. You need to learn and grow, that’s why you’re at high school, and if you’re so busy being yourself that you leave the same person you were when you came in, you really messed up somewhere along the line.</p>
            <p>So go out there, and make what you can out of your highschool experience. Chase your bliss, do what you want and be optimistic, all that sort of stuff. I guess my last piece of advice I can leave you as I end my last lecture, is this: Just be nice to your fellow students, they’re going through this experience to, so be kind.</p>
