            <p>An overstimulated awkwardly placed hermit crab. This is the visual to best describe high school me. And high school me is soon to be a part of my life exiting stage right, so while I’m here let me get out some last few nuggets of wisdom I’ve learned this past bit of my life. I have been going to Maeser for four years now, so I have three years of watching Last Lectures speeches under my belt. I have noticed a theme while watching these talks: Seize the day.</p>
            <p>Speaking as an overstimulated hermit crab, I can’t relate. I really love those talks, I do. For like, two days of my life after those last lectures, I was trying to carpe all of that diem. But I could never commit. Which, admittedly, is where my problem began and the last lecture lessons ended. So while I have the floor, I figured I could tell some advice through the eyes of someone who wants to live her best life, but also really likes staying home on a Friday night. So let’s just call this the ‘Introvert’s Guide To Seizing The Day.’</p>
            <p>Around my 16th year of life, I was getting into the social scenes of my high school experiences. Stomps, hangouts, all that fun jazz.  I remember after one stomp I went with this group of kids to an IHOP and we stayed until like, midnight feasting on their bottomless pancakes and waffle deals. And I remember that night. Because it was so much fun. And immediately after when I got home, I said to myself: “Cool, that was great but I’m going to sleep for thirty hours now because that was mentally exhausting.”</p>
            <p>And you know what, it’s not that bad to admit it, people.</p>
            <p>Here’s the deal. If you don’t want to go to a dance that you made no commitment to go to, it’s okay. It really is okay. I get it; that fear of missing out is real, and the snapchat stories that you’ll watch afterwards are also real. (And pro-tip, they last 24 hours so stay off snapchat until then.) But, if you know you’ll be happier staying home and hanging out with your family, do it. Nobody knows how to take care of yourself better than you do. So if your math class really kicked your butt this week, or you had to go to work the night before and the last thing you want to do is make plans that weekend, then let me be the one say to you; just stay home.</p>
            <p>I feel weird even saying that. It goes against all of the pre-rehearsed lines in my head. ‘What if you miss out?’ ‘What if you wonder how much fun you coulda had?’ This is basically the summary of how I felt most of my senior year, actually. What if? But I know myself. And I know that if I stayed home one of those nights, it was because I wanted to. So to the introvert struggling on what-if’s, I suggest you just take all those lines, and puree that shiz in a blender. Because one weekend won’t define your high school experience.</p>
            <p>And to be clear, this isn’t to say never step out of your comfort zone. “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” It’s true; I read that in BrainyQuotes once. But speaking as a person who really loves being home, it’s okay if you also love being at home.</p>
            <p>Next thing:  if you aren’t going to do something social during your downtime, then you have to make that time count in a way that you’re going to enjoy. Text your buddies, follow along a Bob Ross painting, read a new book. Or if you’re anything like me, rewatch Parks and Rec for the fifth time over. The point isn’t to accept that it’s okay to never be with people. It’s to say when I have the downtime for this and I’m too tired to call up my friends for partying, I’m gonna be just okay painting these happy little trees.</p> 
            <p>So the next time you get FOMO, (which happens to everyone don’t sweat it that hard), think about how to make the most of your time… in a way you really love. High school workloads and your classes get to be a lot. Seize your downtime, introverts. Carpe that diem the only way you know how.</p>
