            <h1>Felt with the Heart</h1>
            <h5>Abigail Crist</h5>
            <p>August 2012 A brand new seventh grader brushes the columns with their tiny, trembling fingertips as they embark on a 6 year journey that will inevitably change their whole life. That seventh grader was me, and I want to tell you that these 6 years would be the most beautiful years I have ever experienced so far.</p>
            <p>As Helen Keller once said, “The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched- they must be felt with the heart.” I hope you listened to that quote very well because it doesn't mean that the things we see or come in contact with aren’t beautiful, they are, but to completely notice beauty, to truly see beauty we must feel it.</p>
            <p>I urge you all, 7th - 12th grade students, to feel the beautiful moments in your middle and high school endeavors because they will rush past if you don't strive to hold them dear to your heart. Hold on to the moments where Mr. Watabe tells you math is simple, hold on to the April Fools joke Mz plays every year about her engagement which I fall for EVERY time, even hold on to those moments when you’re just with your friends at a school event enjoying your time together. These moments will soon be gone, but the feeling you had when they happened will remain in your heart forever.</p>  
            <p>I’m going to share with you one of my most favorite moments and one I will remember forever. It happened at Senior Sunrise: The morning was cold and I was snuggled up to my friend as we complained about it being “too early”. There was food and love for each other that you could just feel in the air. Most of us were on the dock on the lake when all of a sudden I heard someone call out, “ HEY! Let’s try to fit all of the seniors on one section of the dock for a group photo.” We all thought this was a good idea until the sudden sound of a CRACK came from the somewhat quiet atmosphere. The dock had partially fallen into the water which wasn’t a big deal, but then a scream came out of the lips of ½ of the senior class girls and I felt something crawling across my shoe. I looked down and lo and behold there was a cluster of spiders running from every opening in the dock to the dry surface. I don’t think I need to tell you that I ran as fast as possible and pushed everyone out of my way. I mean it, if you timed me running from the end of the dock to the top of the hill you would be AMAZED. I’ve never run that fast in my life and I hope I never will again. You may think that this moment should not be my favorite, it should just be put into a vault and never thought of again, but I mentioned the feeling of love in the air. When we all got off that dock and resumed the surrealness of our last year together, we became one with our “traumatic” memory of the spiders in the dock. The most beautiful memory I have not  just because I saw or even came in contact with the people I loved, but because I felt it in my heart.</p> 
            <p>If you feel like you have no moments, no beauty in your life, start creating them for yourself THIS year, THIS second. I promise you that if you look for and create beauty your year will be 100% better. START NOW! You are students of a school that is waiting for you to create moments with everyone you love. Honestly I hardly remember who won the spirit bowl, I don’t remember the failed quizzes I had, but I will remember the beauty I saw and felt in my friends, in my senior class, in my school Karl G Maeser Preparatory Academy.</p> 
            <p>Now as May 2018 arrives I am not only a senior, but I am a senior that has been given new knowledge, beautiful moments and heartfilled memories. I will brush the columns with my still tiny and trembling fingertips as I now start to embark on a journey that is the first chapter of the rest of my life.</p>
