            <h1>The Hideous Truth of Joy</h1>
            <h5>Christian Cheung</h5>
            <p>Everyday I am bombarded with choices. In the morning I get to choose if I want to eat frosted flakes or fruity pebbles. In the winter I get to choose to freeze to death or wear a winter jacket and get yelled at by Mr Dowdle. At the end of the term I get to choose if I want to do the huge project due the next day that's worth half of my grade or cry myself to sleep.</p>
            <p>But I had one choice five years ago that would change my life drastically.  It was the choice of not moving to Hong Kong with my family. You guys might think not living with your parents is the best thing ever… and it is the best thing ever… but only for the first few months. The first few months is total freedom! No one is around to bug you about anything. Everything is going perfect. Then it hits you’re failing half of your classes, you can’t see the ground in your room, and no one is there to tuck you into bed at night. At that moment, you realize you miss your family.</p>
            <p>In all seriousness, it’s not the goodbyes that hurt. It’s the flashbacks that follow. Feelings of joy only last so long with those around you gone. You find yourself wishing for one last word, one last laugh, one last smile, one last hug, one last cry. To be honest, one last anything.</p>
            <p>I remember the first time I watched Batman. In my cookie monster PJs, I jumped on the dining room table and started to kick and flip everywhere. Then my mom looked at me disappointingly and said “Christian, you are a senior. What are you doing?¨</p>
            <p>In 8th grade, I would never have imagined graduating. I mean that's another 4-5 years of trying not to fail math. But time passes by so fast. To be honest, I haven't felt like a senior until this past month. I mean look at me, I look like I'm twelve. I have a high pitched voice, and I'm pretty sure all of the middle schoolers have grown more facial hair than I have. The only reason I feel like a senior is because every morning I contemplate really hard for thirty minutes if I want to go to school or not. Oh, wait… I've been doing that ever since I was in first grade.</p>
            <p>Maeser has become my home over the years. I'm going to miss many things.  I am going miss the amazing teachers who teach us with patience and love. I’m going to miss going to exciting sports games, funny plays, and empty dances with my friends. I'm going to miss driving up 1600 through traffic every morning to see our beautiful, white museum-looking school. I’m going to miss how we scurry out of class so we can gather in that one spot in the hallway just to talk to each other for a few precious minutes. I am going to miss class bonding through complaining about how we didn’t know anything on the test. I’m going to miss having to laugh hysterically at a teacher's joke because I need that grade. But the thing I will miss the most is definitely how the hallway, without a doubt, always smells like burnt popcorn after fourth period. Seriously though, how hard is it to microwave popcorn?</p>
            <p>I am leaving May 29th to go back to Hong Kong to see my family. I do not have much time left here. Which takes me back to my mom’s question, “Christian, what are you doing?’</p>
            <p>What am I doing to have that one last perfect word with you? What am I doing to see that one last smile on your face? What am I doing to have that one last enjoyable laugh with you? What am I doing so that one last hug will last? What am I doing so that we won't actually have that one last cry be of regret? What am I doing just so we can have that one last anything to be that perfect moment in time that will be forever ingrained into our minds. Just please tell me what I can be doing just so I can feel that joy last because remember, joy only lasts so long when those you love are gone.</p>
