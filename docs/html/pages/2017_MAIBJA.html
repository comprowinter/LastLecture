            <h1>Just a Ghost</h1>
            <h5>Maia Bjarnson</h5>
            <p>I am a ghost. Well, a living ghost. A warm body that walks the school hallways. “Is that Mia? Maia? Bjarnson? Bejarnson? Wait, are you new here?” I have been going here since seventh grade. It is so hard to love yourself when you feel like nobody. It is hard to love yourself when you don’t feel special. “You need to love yourself.” My life has been a series of that phrase. I lay in my bed, my room so messy you can barely see the floor. “Girl, you need to love yourself.” A 4.0 last term, a 3.0 this term, and tears dancing down my cheeks. “It’s okay, you just need to love yourself.” An angry whack of my tennis racket after missing each shot. “Love yourself. Have confidence!” Well, If you were to rip me open you would find a broken heart and dust that lines the walls where my self-love should be.</p>
            <p>“Love yourself! You need to love yourself!” But it is hard. It is hard to find love underneath the dirt in your fingernails and in the way your voice shakes when you talk. It is hard to find love in your report card or in the way your hair never seems to look right. It is hard to find love for yourself when you feel incompetent and unconfident. Maybe you looked for your love. Is it underneath your pillow? Tucked behind your ears? But the thing is, love doesn’t hide. It can disappear without a trace. But love will always come back, if you let it.</p>
            <p>I have been afraid to let my love in since the seventh grade. Maybe it was the mustard polos or the stench of the middle school hallway that drained it from me. Maybe it is just how life goes. You get so caught up in school and tests and homework and “Does he think I’m cute?”, that you forget about yourself. You forget that you need attention too. You forget that looking in the mirror and finding nothing you like, isn’t okay. I have watched so many people grow at this school and I have watched so many people crumble. I have realized how important self-love is.</p>
            <p>A couple of months ago, I was looking back on my highschool life. The way I barely speak in class or how I never was in a play or a star athlete. But you know what? Your self worth is not based upon a plaque hanging on the wall or how many people know who you are. You decide what you are worth. So choose the lottery or the Palace of Versailles.</p>   
            <p>Love yourself! Because life's too short, because sometimes storms last a little too long, because sometimes you are all you have. Loving yourself is a process that you need to learn. Take it slow. Look in your dirty mirror you should have washed a week ago and say, “You can do it. You are strong.” Start there. One step at a time. Take hot baths after a long day, get ice cream at midnight. Know that it is okay to choose sleep over homework sometimes, and it is okay to say “no” without an explanation, it is okay to put yourself first. Love yourself. Talk to that cute girl you have always been scared of. Love yourself. Wear deodorant. Love yourself. Stop comparing. Try something new. Maeser is a demanding school but you need to make sure that you are taking time to do what you want to do. Do not lose yourself in the turbulence of teenage life.</p>
            <p>Yes, I felt like a ghost at this school. Just a warm body walking down the halls. But I am much more than that. I like sushi and Kanye West and the fourth of July. I am not good at math or speaking to new people. But I don’t need validation from anyone else but myself. I don’t care if I went through this school quietly, as long as I can make it, as long as I have learned. “You need to love yourself.” My life has been a series of that phrase but now I am saying it to myself. If you were to rip me open, you would find safety pins and a swiffer duster.</p>
            <p>So love yourself. Try. Because your time at Maeser will be so much better if you do. Love yourself kids, because your life will be so much brighter if you do.</p>
