            <h1>Let's Get Naked</h1>
            <h5>Kalei Tuia</h5>
            <p>The number of times I have rewritten, re-done, revised, and re-started this paper is ridiculous considering the fact that it's still not that good. Bear with me as I attempt to change your perspective in 750 words. But first, if you could all do me a favor. Turn to your neighbor and high five them. Okay, now look out this window into the sun. Okay, so if for some reason you don't get anything out of my amazing paper at least you can say you've been touched and you've seen the light.</p>
            <p>In seventh grade I had a crush on a boy named Elijah Smith. I came into Maeser thinking it would be the watering hole for nerds and basically thinking I was going to be “at the top”. And then reality kicked in and it turned out that I was, and am, a complete loser. Which I is okay with because I had my friend, Beth to be a loser with me. Beth and I met in sixth period PE where we both struggled to make friends. After a while of sharing lotion, running together, and eating lunch together we started to feel comfortable around each other. But all of that only equated to a surface friendship. Until one hot day after school I mustered up enough courage to tell her I liked Elijah. To my surprise she told me she liked him too. And then we bonded in our mutual dislike for the girl he liked. That day was the day we became real friends.</p>
            <p>Sophomore year I danced in BYU’s production of Christmas Around the World. There was a guy who I thought was cute. I don't know weather it was because the Polynesian boys wore oil instead of shirts, or the fact that I’d probably never see this guy again, but I decided it would be a good idea to do something about it. So, as we were leaving I kissed him on the cheek, then I kinda just ran away. This might have been a cute, happy spur of the moment memory, except for the fact that he ended up with my cousin.</p> 
            <p>Moral of the story is that I’m crazy. And you need to crush on someone to get through high school…</p>
            <p>As I was mulling over what wisdom I’ve learned that I could share, my thoughts boiled down to two words—vulnerability and empathy. The two experiences I just shared with you have been a few experiences where I’ve had the idiotic courage to be vulnerable in front of someone else.</p>
            <p>I’ve learned that the strongest relationships are formed when you get naked. Emotionally naked. Senior year I learned that one of my friends is a fish, and another deals with suicidal tendencies. Another struggles with an eating disorder. And another has domestic problems. Another fights addiction, and another is utterly broken inside. In turn I got vulnerable. I told them the burdens I carry that I never imagined I’d tell anyone.</p> 
            <p>Vulnerability demands empathy. Empathy breeds connection. To connect with another's situation you need to connect with a part of yourself that knows what they are feeling.The parts in yourself that say “yeah I've been there before. going 40 on a road looking at a pole, briefly thinking how easy it could all be over” or “yeah I've been there before in a dark room with only tears to keep me company.” Empathy makes you come down to your friend in a dark hole and say “I've been here before. Don't worry, you're not alone.”</p> 
            <p>So, if there's any advice I could possibly give it would be this: at the end of the da I’m not going to remember the tests I aced or failed, or the homework I did or didn't do. I won’t remember the endless class periods I sat through. I'm going to remember people, and experiences. I’ll remember cold nights by lakes with sparklers. The nights spent sending glowing balls into lakes. The ones spent asking people to jump dead cars.The ones spent racing cars. The ones spent on rooftops, and gambling with starbursts. The nights spent dancing tributes to the stars, the ones spent hiking, and the ones spent crowd surfing.</p> 
            <p>These experiences would not have happened if I had hidden behind a barrier that disconnected me from other humans. So let’s get vulnreable, even if that comes in the form of saying hi to a stranger or simply smiling at someone you don’t like. You’ll never know how much you can change someone's life until you get emotionally naked.</p>
