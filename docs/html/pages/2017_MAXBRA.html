            <h1>High School is a Womb</h1>
            <h5>Max Bradshaw</h5>
            <p>Babies scare me. An odd statement, I'm aware. I am also aware that they are completely harmless, but so is Coach Watabe and yet a lot of people seem to be scared of him. Despite all the cute cuddliness that a baby inherently possesses, there is something about them that freaks me out. Maybe I've simply watched too many horror movies with a devil baby in them. But it’s probably the fact that I too, used to be in that helpless and dependent state. And 17 years later, while I may be just as helpless and dependent, now I’m supposed to be graduating and doing stuff on my own.</p>
            <p>High school is exactly like being in a womb. Okay… well maybe not exactly but you get the idea. It is where we, as fetuses, are nurtured in the claustrophobic space that is the middle school hallway. We slowly grow and our organs develop. (But that actually happens in the classrooms, so maybe the middle school hallway is the placenta? I'm pretty sure this is getting too weird… it is, isn't it?). We learn what we are and aren't good at. What we aspire to be, and what we don't want to be. In short, we learn and develop who we are. We also learn more about the world around us through all of the classes that we take. Not only do we learn how to find the rate at which a potato cools using some major math skills (or a lack thereof in my case), but we also learn about people. Who we like, who we want to be around, who inspires us to become a better person and the opposite of those as well. We learn how to deal with all of these. And just when we think we are actually starting to figure this whole thing out and getting comfortable; we are thrust out unceremoniously (since the actual graduation ceremony is basically a delivery room with a little more fanfare, and a lot more spectators) and are now expected to use all of these skills​ we have just developed. And if we can't survive with the amount of development we have, we die, or at least require some major medical attention.</p>
            <p>From the time you were one of those fearsome infants, there were always certain goals that you were expected to achieve, and graduating is one of those (along with potty training and the like). It was some vague expectation that loomed far, far, in the future. Something that you were always supposedly working towards, but never seemed to draw any closer. All the years of looking at a whiteboard in classrooms, listening to (or ignoring) your teachers, procrastinating assignments to the point of tears, and rolling your eyes as much as physically possible (and much bigger mentally) when the question what is morality? Is brought up in yet another socratic discussion. All of these experiences have gone into this moment. Despite it only being 20 something days away, it still doesn’t seem all that real. It stills feels like I'm walking through the middle school hallway (or the placenta as it has come to be known). Which would be the biggest prank of all. That High School didn't take the infant out of me, like it was supposed to. And in 3 weeks, I will have completed that goal. While days seem to drag by slowly. Years seem to fly. It seems like five minutes ago, that I was in freshman socratic. Five minutes spent underwater, without air. Which probably feels about like 4 years.</p>
            <p>And while it may be the end of all of this, the fetus stage. It’s really just the beginning (of the toddler stage). The beginning of entering the “real world” we have heard oh so much about. The beginning of even more school, even more friendships, and kind of the same thing we have already gone through. Basically we’re turning into babies all over again (except this time there is no nap time, nor are there fishy crackers for good behavior). We are to be thrust out from the womb into the big scary world that we know so little about that, naturally, our first reaction is to start bawling.</p>
