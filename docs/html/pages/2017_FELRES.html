            <p>Who are you? It’s the question I ask myself as I stare into my soap stained mirror each morning as I’m brushing my teeth. This is how I start my day. It hasn’t always been my routine. When I was in grade school I was a fat kid. I was known as a Macho man not for my strength but for my size. Everyone assumed that I was full Mexican but little did they know I’m more Chilean than Mexican... Being fat and Chilean made it hard to accept who I am. I didn’t realized that I was just going through a physical phase. I was stereotyped as a mexican and no one cared to ask about my background   That impacted my life because I didn’t have the same respect like the other more “privileged” kid in this “white society and country”. Being how little I was I did not know that I could change, I didn’t like it.But as I got older I realized that I can change. I realized that I wasn’t apart of the stereotype, I spoke up more, I ran a little more, I became my own person.  I know that I am not the only one that has gone through this, everyone has or will go through this, solely for the fact they are different from one another.</p>
            <p>In 2011 I started at a new school here at Maeser. I didn’t know what to expect. Moving schools was new for me and I didn’t want to be stereotyped as ”Macho man” I made 4 new friends, and after a while we started calling ourselves,“The Mannys”  although it doesn’t mean anything to anyone, it meant something to me, I was finally appreciated for who I was. And I was know for a “Manny” rather than “Macho Man” School didn’t feel like an aching bruise anymore it was full of laughter and fun, I tried out for new things and it didn’t make my heart race. I didn’t have the constant thought of failing, instead I got my own opinion. I became confident. Being stereotyped was a thing of the past, confidence is part of who you are, the ability to trust yourself is just the start of your growth.</p>
            <p>Difference is not easy and it’s not supposed to be comfortable, but this is why it’s unique, you learn more through struggling and the suffering, and that is what makes you who you are..  Life is meant for you to progress and try new things, so embrace the difference because it benefits you more than others. After all, this story is about you.</p>
            <p>Society is changing and there will still be judgment regardless of what people say. Being different is how the world runs, who cares if you’re fat, skinny, or have glasses. Who cares if you’re black, white, or Mexican? Your grave is 6 feet under the ground just like everyone else’s. The older you get the more life begins to fade. Love doesn’t fade, and it will teach you to grow. Live your life to the fullest according to YOUR happiness and the betterment of others. So I ask again, who are you?</p>
